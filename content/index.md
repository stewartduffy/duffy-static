Hello! I'm Stewart Duffy, a **Front-End Developer** who makes websites and apps. I mostly trade in the trifecta of HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript, but like any self-respecting digital worker I utilise an array of other tools & tech to get the job done..

I enjoy what I do, and I love the web development community. Naturally I like to meet other fellow web workers, so I regularly go to local meetups, and I jump at the opportunity to attend conferences & workshops to learn from the masters.

### Conferences & Workshops

* JSConf EU 2013 / Berlin, Germany
* Full Frontal Tooling Tutorials 2012 / Brighton, UK
* dotJS 2012 / Paris, France
* WDCNZ 2011 / Wellington, New Zealand

I have been working in the industry for over five years; working on a variety of projects either through freelancing, contracting or permanent employment. With agency, startup & client-side experience I have worked on projects in multiple industries including Education, Retail, Telecommunications, Print Media, Government and Advertising.
